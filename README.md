OVERVIEW:
The file states_img.gif was used in the background and The Data of states stored in the 50_us_states.csv file. The program starts with background_img with no states names and an input text will appears each and every time when the user enters the state names. If the givem state name was within state_list and not already entered one means then that state name will appears in the specified location. The Scores will increase along with number of right answer. The Game ends in two possible ways. Firstly Guessing the wrong name or already specified state name. Secondly once the user guessed all the state names and POV: YOU WON.
